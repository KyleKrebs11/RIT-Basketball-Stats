Rough Plan (Jan 14)…

	Each game will be a “ View “
	Consisting of a table of  “ Plays “
	Goes through row values of CSV in SQL file
	Grab information needed and populate each play in the “ view “
	Once every play in the game is accounted for…
	Save that view into database

	Create query putting all information needed into one csv
	Throw CSV into Data-Analysis folder (github)

    Create program that collects and manipulates data from CSV
    Answer questions, find efficiency ratings, compare to rest of Liberty League
    Create visualizations and make reports


Data Manipulation Questions

	What type of play and action does a team run the most vs least? 
        How successful are they?
        Where are they taking the most vs least shots from?
	        What’s their percentages per type of shot?
        How does this compare to the rest of the Liberty League?
        Give order of who they played best to worst against offensively.

	What type of play and action does a team go against the most vs least?
		How successful is their defense for each?
		Where do they let up the most vs least shots?
	        What’s their percentages allowed per type of shot?
        How does this compare to the rest of the Liberty League?
        Give order of who they played best to worst against defensively.
